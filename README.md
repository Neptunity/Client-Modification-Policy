Recommended clients:
  - Vanilla
  - Optifine


Neutral clients:
  - Our roleplay mod pack


Use at your own risk clients:
  - PvP clients (such as Lunar)
  - Anything with a non-vanilla mechanic


Prohibited clients:
  - Client Modifications giving an advantage over players using a Vanilla Client (Examples: Combat Aim, Auto Block, Auto Clicker, Criticals, Hitbox, Kill Aura, Reach, Velocity, Boat Fly, EntitySpeed, Elytra, Fast Climb, Flight, Jesus, Jump, Motion, No Slow, Speed, Sprint, Step, Strafe, Wall Climb, Baritone, Fast Break, Fast Place, Fast Use, Ground Spoof, Improbable, Scaffold, Timer, Tower)
  - Client sided anti-cheat blocks

Note: For example flight is allowed in lobbies with rank above VIP. The examples apply to scenarios where the action listed above is performed by a modified client in a way that Vanilla could not replicate. For better context: If you can not fly in a BedWars game with a Vanilla client, then it is disallowed.


Punishment info:

Recommended clients - Anything mentioned under the "Recommended clients section". There is a low chance of getting punished if using any of these clients. If it happens, then do not hesitate to open a ticket and we will get to it right away.

Neutral clients - The same as "Recommended clients" except these clients are not in the recommended section because there is nothing special about them, or they only change things on a certain server, etc.

Use at own risk clients - If using these clients, staff will not ban you, the Anti-Cheat could. If you open a ticket about an issue that was created with anything other than the "Recommended clients" or the "Neutral clients" it will be immediately archived.

Prohibited clients - If using any of these, you may get punished by the anti-cheat or staff. By using these clients you are ruining the experience for others. We want to provide everyone (this includes you) a great experience on our server. This is why we have a strong policy against these clients.

Note: Anti-cheat bans always last 7 days, staff bans may last longer!

We reserve the right to change this any time!

These changes first take effect after the caves and cliffs part one (1.17) update on 𝐉𝐮𝐧𝐞 𝟖, 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟏.
